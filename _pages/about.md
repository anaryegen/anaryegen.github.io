I am a second-year Ph.D candidate at <a href='https://www.hitz.eus/'>HiTZ: Basque Center for Language Technology</a>, the University of the Basque Country where I am supervised by [Rodrigo Agerri](https://ragerri.github.io). My main research interests are factuality, information extraction, multilingual and low-resource NLP.

Prior to the Ph.D, I got a double M.Sc in <b>Natural Language Processing</b> in 2022 at the Univerity of Lorraine (France) and the University of the Basque Country (Spain) where I was funded by [The Erasmus Mundus European Masters Program in Language and Communication Technologies (LCT)](https://lct-master.org/) scholarship. Before that, I completed my BSc in Computer Science. My journey into NLP began with my BSc thesis on <b>Question-answering systems</b> and then the research on <b>Discourse Parsing</b> and <b>Argument Mining</b> during two years of the MSc degree.
