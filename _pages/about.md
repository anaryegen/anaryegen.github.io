I am a second-year Ph.D candidate at [HiTZ: Basque Center for Language Technology](https://www.hitz.eus/), the University of the Basque Country where I am advised by [Rodrigo Agerri](https://ragerri.github.io). My research is focused on <b><u>Argument Mining (AM)</u></b> in its broadest sense. I am interested in the latest advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and exploring their applications in AM to enhance the argumentative capabilities of current state-of-the-art solutions. All of it with multilinguality in mind. 

Before starting my Ph.D, I got a B.Sc in <b>Computer Science</b> in 2019 and a M.Sc in <b>Natural Language Processing</b> in 2022. My journey into NLP began with my Bachelor's thesis on <b>Question-answering systems</b> and continued the research on <b>Discourse Parsing</b> and <b>Argument Mining</b> during two years of the Master's degree.
